# RDU-IC901
IC-901 Controller Clone Project

SW and HW repo for the IC-901 controller clone.  This project replaces the remote controller chip with a Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller.

IC901_NB_source folder holds the in-process source files.  Files are updated there as the project progresses.  To clone the project,
Grab the zipped project archive and "install" it on the host computer.  Then, go to the source files and copy these over the files from the
zipped project.  The result should be the most current project ready for compile (perform a clean build at this point).
