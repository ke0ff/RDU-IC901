# RDU-IC901
IC-901 Controller Clone Project

SW (bare-metal) and HW repo for the IC-901 controller clone (now designated IC-901F).  This project replaces the remote controller chip with a Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller.

IC901_NB_source folder holds the in-process source files.  Files are updated there as the project progresses.  To clone the project,
Grab the zipped project archive and "install" it on the host computer.  Then, go to the source files and copy them over the files from the
zipped project and place in the same folder as the existing source files.  The result should be the most current project ready for compile
(perform a clean build at this point).  Note that this project was executed in CCS6.  Newer versions of CCS should import it, but the standard
YMMV clause is in effect (as always).
